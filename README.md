# Time is Money Frontend
## About
---
Time is Money is a stock/crytpo tracker that helps users keep track of the market as well as their money. Users are able to search their desired stock or crypto currency and get back information of their commodity by date. For the stock tracker, the user also gets back a graph of 100 trading dates (about 4 months) that shows the open, high, low, and close of the searched stock.

#### Blockers
---
One of the blockers that I had to overcome was successfully getting the data to display on the chart. This was the first project that I was able to successfully use an api to help compliment my project. Since this was my first time doing this, I had a difficult time finding a way to refactor the data into a format that CanvasJS React Charts was able to understand. However, I am proud to say that after alot of trial and error I was able to get the chart to display.

#### Future Modifications

I will continue to develop this project into a an amazing application. I am going to make it mobile friendly in the near future. I will also give users the option to chose what sets of data they get back for the stock/crypto they are searching for. I will also create a chart for the crypto. I will also add user auth.
